Dear Anjali ❤️
Happy Birthday! 🎉

Naaku eppudoo cheppaleni maatalevi leni laga anipistundi… endukante, nee gurinchi cheppalante words saripovu. Nuvvu just oka friend kaadhu — naa constant support, naa peace, and naa favourite person since the day we met. 💫

Nuvvu naa best lo, worst lo kooda naa daggara unnav. Nuvvu navvuthune unte surroundings motham light ayipotayi. Nee presence tho college, life, anni chinna moments kooda memorable ayipoyayi.

Nenu sometimes fight chestha, jealous avutaa, possessive ga behave chestha… kani adi endukante nuvvu naaku chala close. Nuvvu naa “one and only Best Friend,” and no one can replace that place. ❤️

After so long, finally tomorrow manam kalusthunam — and I’m genuinely happy for that! Feels like meeting an old part of life again after so many memories from our farewell day. Can’t wait to see that same smile and vibe again. 😄💛

Nee birthday lo cheppalani undi — thank you for being such a genuine and amazing friend.
Manaki konni rojul break ochina, communication tagina, mana friendship ade strength tho untundi.

Once again, Happy Birthday Anjali!
Stay happy, stay same, and keep smiling always. 😄💛
Your friend always,
Kesava 💛
